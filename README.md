# Lauren Miller Profile
## *Telling Stories with Data, Fall 2023*
The following page is Lauren Miller's (she/her) public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data in association with Carnegie Mellon University's Master of Arts Management program.

## About Me:
I graduated summa cum laude from **the College of William & Mary** in May 2022 with BA degrees in Linguistics and Theatre. At the college, I worked extensively in artistic leadership, where my efforts helped the Collegeâ€™s arts programming thrive as a unified, communicative, and welcoming environment. My most recent professional experience lies with the Aspen Music Festival and School in Colorado and the Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium in Pennsylvania. I have a passion for management, specifically targeting solutions to language and culture based inequities in the artistic sector. To this end, I am a second year Master of Arts Management student at **Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College** with a May 2024 graduation date. 

## What I Hope to Learn:
The productive leverage of data visualization in the arts sector holds the power to invite substantial change in campaigns for both community support and external funding. As such, I look forward to using the skills gathered in this course to become an asset for visually-driven storytelling in my future arts organization of employment. 
_Most specifically, I hope to gather the following:_
* An understanding of how to use an array of graphic visualization softwares
* A comprehension of how to be as concise, yet as effective as possible, in data visualization
* How to best apply my current understanding of design aesthetics from an artistic standpoint to best practice in the design of graphics
* As is applicable to certain softwares and the scope of the course, the ability to apply my current coding skills developed in my undergraduate and graduate studies to learn productive systems for displaying and integrating data-driven storytelling in my future work at arts organizations
