# Final Project Part II: Writeframes and Storyboarding
[Return to Home Page](/README.md)

## Wireframes
As introduced in the [previous section of this assignment](/finalprojectp1.md), the structure of this project is best organized through a series of questions, beginning with crafting a broad understanding of how many individuals in the US speak a language other than English, and ending on a call to action for educators and education policy-makers to take steps to treat English as **a** language of education in the US, not **the** language of education. This question-based format is copied below for reference: 

  1. What percentage of U.S. citizens speak a language other than English, how has this changed over time? (_**Source:** US Census Bureau_)
  2. What percentage of U.S. K-12 public school students are considered "English Learners" (_**Source:** National Center for Education Statistics_)
  3. How is English-learning affected by age? & What are the effects of time/aging on children's ability to learn English? (_**Sources:** Handbook of Bilingualism and US Census Bureau_)
  4. What does data suggest on how non-native language instruction affects student performance? (_**Source:** UNESCO and Journal of American Indian Education_)
  5. How can multilingualism and non-native language be addressed in U.S. education? (_**Potential Source:** USAID_)
     
From these questions and work completed in the preliminary research stages, I was able to contrust the forthcoming early draft data visualizations. Notably, these visualizations are designed to be amenable to editing and reworking pending any story restructuring or eventual development of the Shorthand mood and theme.
