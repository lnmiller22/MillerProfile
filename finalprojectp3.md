## Substantial Changes Made Between Parts II and III
* Resized all Tableau visualizations to make them fit more reasonably within the margins of the Shorthand page. Further, as requested, I increased the size of several of the visualizations' titles, increased white space, and reduced font size slightly on the included sources for the visualizations. _(After looking at the story on several of my peers' screens, however, I realized that Tableau and Shorthand will not present the same on every device, so I did the best I could on this front with the information I had. Once again, however, none of my interviewees--even when prompted-- in Part II were bothered by the spacing of these visuals, so I am not substantially concerned with the sizing that I cannot get completely perfect.)_
* Introduced more white space and spacers to make the story feel less cluttered.
* Developed call-out, color-coordinated text elements to make strong concluding statements included within the sections stand out. Colors cordinate with the overall scheme, but their size and contrast to white on black text make them pop. 
* Updated all citations to provide easier cross-reference between content and the bibliography _(e.g. including the title of the piece in the in text citation, not solely the organization in cases in which no author or publication information was provided)_
* Unified the color scheme of all visuals, so it was made consistent that green was the associated color of native English speakers while teal was the associated color of "English Learners." Two of my three interviewees noticed this without prompting in the draft, so I worked to strengthen this theming that clearly had an impact. 
* Added a set of statistics from the National Center for Education Statistics to pull in the role of ESOL teachers in the current conversation following the perspective of audience members in Part II. I ultimately decided **not** to make a new infographic, as I felt that developing a fully new visual in the same graphic-heavy subsection would have been overwhelming to readers.
* Built out the final "Resources" section to include brief case studies of Guatemala and Mozambique, an explicit call to action, and working links in the additional call-to-action resources.
* Updated the final bibliography with new sources integrated since Part I, and posted the final list on the site.
