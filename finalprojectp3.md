## Leaps From Part II to Part III
In addition to grammatical or aesthetic shifts determined on my own accord, a majority of the changes made between drafting and ultimate publication of my Shorthand story were determined by the highly influential participation of educators in the interview process during Part II of this assignment. In fact, speaking with those two interviewees helped me hone in on the fact that I could not simply **assume** that all educators would take the information as applicable to them in terms of _an actual need to take action_, not just mere awareness that there is a substantial problem. For this reason, the early and later stages of the report needed to be adapted to generalize my audience-- something I was not expecting to have to do as I was sorting through the mass of data at the beginning of this project process. To explain further, for the final section, the ultimate "point" of my text ended up being that large scale movements towards language-based equity need to begin with a (widespread as possible) mindset change in all individuals involved in education and education policy (i.e. the education sector). For this reason, it would not have been acceptable to solely have the call to action be support for policy or requests for more ESOL teachers/training in schools. 

To shape my ultimate call to action for a purposefully broad audience, I ended up walking readers through two success stories, with the second (more recent case study) grounded in the fact that ideological change was realized as necesary before implemented programs could be able to actually succeed. Then, I was able to conclude with a call to action statement with explicitly broad language (read: "Members of the education sector..." and "...may be implemented by any and all members of the sector") supplemented with an assortment of different **types** of resources (case studies, research reports, blogs, etc.) to meet the wide audience at the levels at which they may be most comfortable moving forward. I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to speak with one of the Part II interviewees after making these changes; they agreed with the decision and stated that the reworked in-text language made them feel much more like the important statistics connected logically to action they could reasonably take in their own role within their school. Further, this educator appreciated the addition of a paragraph on ESOL education shortcomings to better capture the reality of the ecosystem with which they engage daily.

Notably, my key audience members (educators and education policy makers) never changed between the three sections of this assignment. Rather, I found throughout this process that I needed to make a conscious effort to create storytelling narrow enough in the early stages (see: accessing one's own state or grade level data) to draw readers in, and broad enough in the call to action to ensure education sector readers understand that the starting ideological change is something with which they may (and should) all easily participate. 

A more comprehensive list of all changes I made between Part II and Part III is included below:

* Resized all Tableau visualizations to make them fit more reasonably within the margins of the Shorthand page. Further, as requested, I increased the size of several of the visualizations' titles, increased white space, and reduced font size slightly on the included sources for the visualizations. _(After looking at the story on several of my peers' screens, however, I realized that Tableau and Shorthand will not present the same on every device, so I did the best I could on this front with the information I had. Once again, however, none of my interviewees--even when prompted-- in Part II were bothered by the spacing of these visuals, so I am not substantially concerned with the sizing that I cannot get completely perfect.)_
* Introduced more white space and spacers to make the story itself feel less cluttered.
* Developed call-out, color-coordinated text elements to make strong concluding statements included within the sections stand out. Colors cordinate with the overall scheme, but their size and contrast to white on black text make them pop. 
* Updated all citations to provide easier cross-reference between content and the bibliography _(e.g. including the title of the piece in the in text citation, not solely the organization in cases in which no author or publication information was provided)_
* Unified the color scheme of all visuals, so it was made consistent that green was the associated color of native English speakers while teal was the associated color of "English Learners." Two of my three interviewees noticed this without prompting in the draft, so I worked to strengthen this theming that clearly had an impact. 
* Added a set of statistics from the National Center for Education Statistics to pull in the role of ESOL teachers in the current conversation following the perspective of audience members in Part II. I ultimately decided **not** to make a new infographic, as I felt that developing a fully new visual in the same graphic-heavy subsection would have been overwhelming to readers.
* Built out the final "Resources" section to include brief case studies of Guatemala and Mozambique, an explicit call to action, and working links in the additional call-to-action resources.
* As mentioned above, adapted the lanuage in storytelling to capture the wide audience to whom widespread ideological change is targeted. 
* Updated the final bibliography with new sources integrated since Part I, and posted the final list on both the Shorthand page and the present writeup.

## Reflection 
I genuinely enjoyed working through every stage of this project. One of my largest passions lies in the study of language and promotion of linguistic equity (particularly in the artistic sector). To this end, my mom has been an educator for her entire career, and watching her come to be more passionate and vocal about the equitable treatment of English Learner K-6 students at her place of work has been wonderful to see. In addition to using this project to build out my visualization-creation skills on various softwares, I was able to construct a written and visual story that may serve as a resource to express the importance of linguistically equitable practices in public education to impact members of the sector in a similar way to how I have directly seen my mom influenced. 

In the future, I see myself continuing to engage with writing similar to the structure of the present article either professionally or as a side project, and throughout this process I have been pleased to gain more skills regarding how visualized elements and data storytelling may aid the overall power of my work as I move forward. In particular, I will certainly continue to: 1) explicitly define (and as needed, redefine) my intended audience at the start of work, and 2) integrate the storyboards/interview process to ensure that my work is actually being developed for the people I intend the work to engage with, rather than in a void of my own thoughts and expectations. Upon reflection, both of these stages were central in the development of my ultimate story. 

It often feels challenging to streamline and make accessible conversations surrounding what an individual is passionate about. Yet, the laddered structure of this project (as reflected largely in [Part I](/finalprojectp1.md) and [Part II](/finalprojectp2.md)) allowed for the development of an accessible piece of writing/storytelling that interacted directly with a passion I have had a hard time expressing the scale and importance of previously. I sincerely look forward to using the data visualization (primarily, Tableau-- which I had a lot of fun with) and storytelling tools gathered in this course as a framework for professional projects to come.
