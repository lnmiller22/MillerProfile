# Final Project Part III: Final Deliverable 
[Return to Home](/README.md)


## Substantial Changes Made Between Parts II and III
* Resized all Tableau visualizations to make them fit more reasonably within the margins of the Shorthand page. Further, as requested, I increased the size of several of the visualizations' titles, increased white space, and reduced font size slightly on the included sources. _(After looking at the story on several of my peers' screens, however, I realized that Tableau and ShortHand will not present the same on every device, so I did the best I could on this front with the information I had. Once again, however, none of my interviewees in Part II were bothered by the spacing of these visuals, so I am not substantially concerned.)_
* Introduced more white space to make the story feel less cluttered
* Seperated call-out, color-coordinated text elements to make strong concluding statements included within the sections stand out
* Updated all citations to provide easier cross-reference between content and the bibliography _(e.g. including the title of the piece, not solely the organization when no author or publication information was provided)_
* Unified the color scheme of all visuals, so it was made consistent that green was the associated color of native English speakers while teal was the associated color of "English Learners"
* Added a set of statistics from the National Center for Education Statistics to pull in the role of ESOL teachers in the current conversation. I ultimately decided **not** to make a new infographic, as I felt that developing a fully new visual in the same graphic-heavy subsection would have been overwhelming to readers.
* Built out the final "Resources" section to include brief case studies and working links in the call-to-action.
